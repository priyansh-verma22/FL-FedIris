# FL:FedIris

This project deals with the Biometric Recognition.
Iris Recognition- It works in decentralized manner, contains different clients with indicate different datasets and train the model on different dataset without sharing the data directly.


## Features

- Decentralized Data
- Data Privacy
- Used Different Dataset


## Tech Stack

**Client:** Tensorflow, Flwr, etc.

**Server:** Flwr, Tensorflow, 


## Installation

Install these 
1. Anaconda
2. Create new Environment
3. Python 3.10
4. Flwr
5. Tensorflow
6. other ML libraries
    
## Instruction

1. Run the server model first with bash
2. You will see the bash/terminal get connect with the project
3. Then run each client all together
## Requirement

DataSet- IIT Delhi , Casia Iris .
Model- DeepIrisNet2/ RestNet50
